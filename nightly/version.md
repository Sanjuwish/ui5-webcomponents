    feat(ui5-avatar): add disabled property (#7335)
    
    * feat(ui5-avatar): add disabled property
    
    There is a requirement for a new 'disabled' property.
    The new property makes the Avatar non-interactive regardless of its
    'interactive' property. It also adds opacity to its visual representation.
