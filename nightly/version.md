    docs(ui5-split-button): provide an example for opening a menu (#7193)
    
    Added are examples in Playground and Storybook where a Split Button opens a Menu and Split Button opens a Menu with associated last action (that would mean that when an action is chosen from the menu, the text of the Split Button changes to that action)
