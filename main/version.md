    chore: improve DatePicker/TimePickerBase types (brought over from OpenUI5) (#6753)
    
    Ð¢hose types were in the meantime improved in the copy in the OpenUI5 repo, but reverted by the latest copy.
    I redid the improvements in I9663c71d80280bb0841fb8a2e36c44a174378955, but they would be overridden again. Am I right assuming that the DateTimePicker etc. get the types from these two base classes?
    The commit message mimics the one of e50e00c
