    feat(ui5-menu): dispatch ui5-before-open for the sub-menus (#7064)
    
    * feat(ui5-menu): dispatch ui5-before-open for the sub-menus
    
    The ui5-before-open event is now getting fired for the
    sub-menus as well. As a result the application developers
    would be able to fetch data from a database before a sub-menu
    gets opened. In the meanwhile the busy state of the sub-menu
    will be displayed.
